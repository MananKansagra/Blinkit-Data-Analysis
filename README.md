# üìä Key Business Insights from Blinkit Data:
## Orders Insights:
Dairy & Breakfast is the most frequently ordered category, with 566 orders, which is 69% higher than Baby Care, the least ordered category (334 orders).

Despite being the top category by volume, Dairy & Breakfast contributes only 11.32% to the total order count ‚Äî indicating a wide spread across other categories too.

Baby Care shows the biggest gap between average order value and order count ‚Äî suggesting fewer orders but higher-value purchases in that category.

Over the 12-month period, the monthly order value ranged from ‚Çπ2.53 lakh to ‚Çπ5.54 lakh, highlighting seasonal demand variations.

Customer 51036 placed the most orders in terms of quantity (70 items) and also had the highest total order value (‚Çπ65,212.70) ‚Äî indicating a high-value customer worth targeting for loyalty programs.
## üß† Customer Sentiment & Behavior Insights
Customer Group 4 represents the largest segment, accounting for 34.16% of all customers ‚Äî this group could be key to retention and targeting strategies.

Neutral sentiment orders are the highest in volume with 1,738 orders, followed closely by Negative (1,642) and Positive (1,620) sentiments ‚Äî indicating limited difference in sentiment distribution.

Delivery-related Neutral feedback alone contributes to 8.92% of total orders, suggesting customer expectations around delivery need monitoring.

On average, customers with Neutral sentiment placed the most orders (434.50), slightly ahead of Negative (410.50) and Positive (405.00) ‚Äî showing that even neutral or dissatisfied customers continue to engage, though improvement may drive stronger loyalty.
## üìà Marketing & Conversion Insights
New Users generated the highest number of conversions (75,756) ‚Äî which is 2.93% more than Premium users, who had the lowest at 73,603.

New Users contributed to 25.42% of all conversions, making them a key audience for growth-focused campaigns.

The largest gap between spend and conversions was seen in the 'All' audience group, where spend exceeded conversions by ‚Çπ40.36 lakh ‚Äî indicating a less efficient use of budget for broad targeting.

Among all marketing channels, the App channel had the highest average cost per conversion (CRPC) at ‚Çπ56.07, followed by Social Media, SMS, and Email ‚Äî suggesting App conversions are costlier but possibly more impactful.
## üöö Delivery Performance Summary (in Minutes)
The average delivery time is just 4.44 minutes, which is excellent in speed, but surprisingly, the on-time delivery rate is low at only 38.04% ‚Äî indicating timing promises may not align with expectations.

Out of 5,000 total orders, 3,098 were delayed, meaning over 60% of orders failed to meet the promised delivery window, despite the short actual delivery time.

The main reason for delays is traffic, which accounts for 61.96% of delayed deliveries, followed by unspecified reasons (38.04%).

Sentiment analysis shows:

Most feedback is Neutral, even across all feedback categories ‚Äî App Experience, Customer Service, Delivery, and Product Quality.

This suggests that while service is functioning, customers aren't overly impressed or dissatisfied ‚Äî leaving room for improvement in experience.

The Distance vs. Delivery Time trend shows:

Delivery times are mostly consistent across distances around 3.2‚Äì3.4 km.

However, traffic delays still cause noticeable spikes, showing the impact of real-world conditions.

Delivery status breakdown:

3,500 orders were delivered on time

1,000 orders were slightly delayed

500 orders were significantly delayed
‚Üí This means 30% of orders were delayed beyond acceptable levels.

The average distance covered per delivery is 2.72 km, confirming this is a short-distance, quick-commerce model ‚Äî but still affected by urban traffic bottlenecks.
## üì¶ Inventory & Stock Damage Insights
Dairy & Breakfast reported the highest damaged stock (8,890 units) ‚Äî 84% more than Baby Care, which had the lowest (4,828 units).

Damaged stock is positively correlated with the total stock received, meaning more stock received tends to result in more damage ‚Äî possibly due to handling or storage limitations.

Dairy & Breakfast alone accounts for 11.08% of all damaged stock, indicating a critical area to improve packaging or transit care.

The largest gap between stock received and damaged stock was seen in Pet Care, where 9,993 more units were received than damaged ‚Äî suggesting better stock condition or lower damage rate in that category.

Product variety is also highest in Dairy & Breakfast (30 products) and lowest in Baby Care (16 products) ‚Äî meaning more SKUs may also lead to higher chances of stock damage.
